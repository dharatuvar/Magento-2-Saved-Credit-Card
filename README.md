# Magento 2 Saved Credit Card

[***Magento 2 Saved Credit Card***](https://meetanshi.com/magento-2-saved-credit-card.html) by Meetanshi lets customer save their credit card details in the Magento 2 database using built in encryption for offline order processing.:

The default offered the feature to save credit card details in encrypted format for offline order processing. However the Magento 2 platform does not support it. To overcome this default limitation, Meetanshi has developed Magento 2 Saved Credit Card extension.
